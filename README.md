# Zclassic electronjs wallet


Wallet for zero-knowledge cryptocurrencies for Windows, MacOS, and Linux (Supports Zclassic for now)


### Installation
Note: First time installations may take awhile to load since ~1GB of cryptographic data must be downloaded first.

##### Windows
The simplest way to get started TEST on Windows [download, unzip and run .ex] (https://github.com/BTCP-community/Zclassic-electronjs-wallet/releases).


##### Linux and MacOS
Note: Requires that the compiled wallets are named zcld-linux and are saved into the Zclassic electronjs wallet directory. Need electronjs packager for build.
